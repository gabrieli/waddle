> An AI-powered software development team that waddles through multiple stages of software development. Software engineering best practices at your fingertips and tiny feet.

## Overview

Waddle is a comprehensive development workflow framework that simulates a complete software development team using AI. It enforces industry best practices through structured roles, automated reviews, and quality-first principles.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **5 Development Roles**: Product Manager, Technical Architect, Developer, Security Expert, and QA Tester
- **6 Review Specialists**: Architectural, Security, Testing, Documentation, DevOps, and UX reviews

- Create epics and user stories
- Define acceptance criteria

### 2. Architecture Phase
- Design scalable systems
- Create technical specifications
- Define implementation approach

### 3. Development Phase
- Follow TDD practices
- Implement in small iterations
- Use functional programming principles

### 4. Security Review
