## Daily Development Workflow

### Morning Routine
1. Review implementation plan
2. Check completed tasks
3. Identify day's goals
4. Set up development environment

### Development Process
1. Write tests first (TDD)
2. Implement feature
3. Run tests locally
4. Update documentation
5. Commit with clear message
6. Update progress tracker

### End of Day
1. Push all changes
2. Update USER_STORIES.md progress
3. Note any blockers
4. Plan next day's work

## Key Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start in development mode
npm test            # Run tests
npm run build       # Build for production
npm run lint        # Check code quality

# Testing
npm test -- --watch # Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --coverage # Check coverage

# Running locally
npm link            # Link for local testing
waddle start        # Test CLI

# Release
npm version patch   # Bump version
npm publish        # Publish to npm
```

## Critical Path Items

These items block other work and should be prioritized:

1. **Database schema** - Everything depends on this
2. **MCP protocol implementation** - Needed for Claude Code integration  
3. **Headless execution** - Core functionality
4. **Basic orchestrator loop** - Makes system autonomous

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Claude CLI changes**: Abstract CLI interface
2. **MCP protocol updates**: Follow spec closely
3. **Performance issues**: Profile early and often
4. **Database corruption**: Implement backup/restore

### Schedule Risks
1. **Scope creep**: Stick to MVP features
2. **Testing time**: Automate everything possible
3. **Documentation**: Write as you code
4. **Unknown unknowns**: Add buffer time

## Definition of Done Checklist

For each story:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests where applicable
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed (self-review for solo project)
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Progress tracker updated

## Success Metrics

Track these during development:
- Test coverage percentage
- Build time
- Bundle size
- Time to complete each story
- Bugs found in testing
- Documentation completeness

## Notes for Future Development

### Extensibility Points

- Bundle splitting

### Monitoring Additions
- Prometheus metrics
- OpenTelemetry tracing
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Analytics dashboard
- Cost tracking

## Quick Recovery Guide

If you need to resume work after a break:

1. Check `USER_STORIES.md` for progress
2. Run `npm test` to ensure working state
3. Review recent commits
4. Check for dependency updates
5. Continue with next uncompleted task

Remember: This is a living document. Update it as you learn and adjust the plan based on actual progress.
