## 🚀 Quick Start

If you're resuming work on this project:

1. **Check Progress**: Open [USER_STORIES.md](./USER_STORIES.md) to see which stories are completed
2. **Review Plan**: Check [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for the current phase
3. **Understand Architecture**: Read [TECHNICAL_DISCOVERY.md](./TECHNICAL_DISCOVERY.md) for system design
4. **Start Coding**: Pick up the next unchecked story and begin implementation

## 🎯 Project Vision

Waddle enables developers to describe features in natural language and have them automatically implemented through autonomous AI agents working in different roles (architect, developer, reviewer).

### Key Features
- 🤖 Autonomous development orchestration
- 🔄 Continuous workflow management

- 🛠️ MCP integration with Claude Code
- 🎯 Role-based AI execution
- 💾 Persistent context management

## 📋 Current Status

- **Phase**: Not Started
- **Stories Completed**: 0/10
- **Next Story**: Story 1 - Core Infrastructure Setup

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20+
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Web UI**: React + Vite
- **CLI Framework**: Commander.js
- **AI Integration**: Claude CLI (headless mode)
- **Protocol**: MCP (Model Context Protocol)
