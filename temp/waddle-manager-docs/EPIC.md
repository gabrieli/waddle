# Epic: Waddle - Autonomous Development Orchestration System

## Epic Description
Build a complete autonomous development orchestration system that manages software development workflows by coordinating AI agents through architecture, development, and review phases. The system should run continuously, accept new features via MCP interface, and spawn headless Claude instances to complete work autonomously.

## Business Value
- Enables 24/7 autonomous development without human intervention
- Reduces context switching for developers
- Maintains consistent development practices
- Provides full visibility into development pipeline
- Accelerates feature delivery by 10x

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Core Functionality
- [ ] Waddle runs as a persistent background service
- [ ] Accepts feature requests via MCP interface from Claude Code
- [ ] Automatically orchestrates work through architecture → development → review → testing phases
- [ ] Spawns headless Claude instances with appropriate role contexts
- [ ] Maintains persistent state in SQLite database
- [ ] Handles failures gracefully with retry logic

### 2. User Interface
- [ ] Web dashboard accessible at http://localhost:8080
- [ ] Real-time progress updates for all features
- [ ] Manual intervention capabilities (pause, resume, reprioritize)
- [ ] Historical view of completed work

### 3. Integration
- [ ] Works seamlessly with Claude Code via MCP tools
- [ ] Supports multiple concurrent features
- [ ] Provides REST API for external integrations

### 4. Installation & Distribution
- [ ] Installable via `npm install -g @waddle.run/mcp`
- [ ] Single command startup: `waddle start`
- [ ] Comprehensive README with quick start guide
- [ ] Published to npm registry
- [ ] Open source on GitHub with MIT license

### 5. Developer Experience
- [ ] TypeScript codebase with full type safety
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- [ ] Well-documented API
- [ ] Example configurations included

## Technical Discovery
See [TECHNICAL_DISCOVERY.md](./TECHNICAL_DISCOVERY.md) for detailed technical specifications.

## Success Metrics
- Zero-touch feature completion rate > 80%
- Average feature completion time < 4 hours
- System uptime > 99%
- Developer satisfaction score > 4.5/5

## Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1 - Foundation** (Week 1): Project setup, database layer
- **Phase 2 - Core Engine** (Week 2-3): MCP server, executor, orchestrator
- **Phase 3 - User Interface** (Week 4): Web dashboard, CLI
- **Phase 4 - Production Ready** (Week 5): Testing, documentation, publishing

## Risks and Mitigation
1. **Risk**: Claude API rate limits
   - **Mitigation**: Implement exponential backoff and queue management

2. **Risk**: Complex state management
   - **Mitigation**: Use proven patterns and extensive testing

3. **Risk**: User adoption challenges
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Dependencies
- Claude CLI installed on user's system
- Node.js 20+ runtime
- Internet connection for Claude API

## Out of Scope
- Multi-tenant support
- Cloud hosting service
- Authentication/authorization (local use only)
- Multiple AI provider support (Claude only for v1)
- Distributed execution (single instance only)

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria met
- Test coverage > 80%
- Documentation complete
- Published to npm registry
- GitHub repository public with MIT license
- Example project demonstrating usage
