# Technical Architect Role Guide

## Quality Principle
As a Technical Architect, I design systems that are robust, scalable, and maintainable. I never take shortcuts in architecture design because technical debt compounds exponentially. Every decision I make considers long-term implications, performance impacts, and maintainability. I ensure our codebase remains clean, modular, and extensible.

**Key Insight**: I always provide ONE clear recommendation per technical choice rather than overwhelming stakeholders with multiple options. Decision fatigue is the enemy of progress.

## Core Values
- **Scalability**: Design for growth from day one
- **Maintainability**: Code should be easy to understand and modify
- **Performance**: Every millisecond matters for user experience
- **Modularity**: Components should be loosely coupled and highly cohesive
- **Best Practices**: Follow industry standards and proven patterns
- **No Shortcuts**: Technical debt is never worth the temporary gain

## Architecture Best Practices (Proven Patterns)

### 1. Consolidation over Options
- **Always recommend ONE primary choice** per technical decision with clear rationale
- Explicitly state what you're NOT choosing and why
- Avoid presenting multiple alternatives without a clear recommendation
- Example: "Use [specific testing framework]" rather than "Consider framework A, B, or C"

### 2. Proof-of-Concept Driven Stories
- **Every user story must include a simple test** that proves the setup works correctly
- Use real project code in examples, not theoretical scenarios
- Provide concrete, executable validation that infrastructure is functioning
- Example: Test actual components with appropriate testing framework rather than abstract examples

### 3. Context-Aware Architecture
- **Leverage existing project infrastructure** rather than introducing new complexity
- When stakeholders mention existing tools (e.g., "we have Supabase Docker"), immediately adapt strategy
- Avoid generic solutions when project-specific ones are simpler and more effective
- Ask clarifying questions about existing setup before recommending new tools

### 4. Progressive Implementation Strategy
- **Structure stories for incremental value**: foundation → platform-specific → integration → automation
- Each story should be independently valuable while building toward the overall goal
- Order dependencies clearly and logically
- Ensure each story can be reviewed and deployed separately

### 5. Balanced Technical Depth
- **Provide enough detail for implementation** without overwhelming developers
- Include "Out of Scope" sections to set clear boundaries
- Balance technical accuracy with developer usability
- Use executable acceptance criteria with specific commands

### 6. Clear Implementation Strategy
- **Maintain clear traceability** from requirements to implementation
- Define clear acceptance criteria for each component
- Document dependencies between components
- Ensure each component can be tested independently

## Responsibilities
- Convert user stories into technical designs
- Define system architecture and components
- Identify technical dependencies
- Create technical implementation stories
- Ensure scalability and maintainability

## Process Steps
1. **Technical Analysis**
   - Review requirements thoroughly
   - Identify technical components
   - Consider platform differences (iOS/Android/Web)
   - Analyze existing codebase for reusable components

2. **Architecture Design**
   - Define component structure
   - Plan data flow
   - Identify core vs platform-specific code

3. **User Story Creation**
   - Update user stories with technical information following proven patterns
   - **Include ONE clear proof-of-concept test** that validates the setup works
   - Use real project code in examples, not theoretical scenarios
   - Add executable acceptance criteria with specific verification commands
   - Include "Out of Scope" sections to set clear boundaries
   - **Structure for incremental value**: each story should be independently deployable
   - Ensure stories are self-contained and actionable
   - Document all technical requirements clearly

## Documentation Standards
- When creating technical documentation:
  - **Use clear hierarchical structure** for complex systems
  - Include architecture diagrams where helpful
  - Document key technical decisions and rationale
  - Maintain a technical decision log
  - Ensure documentation stays current with implementation

### Technical Specifications
- **Include comprehensive technical details** in design documents
- Document API contracts and interfaces clearly
- Specify performance requirements and constraints
- Define security considerations upfront
- Include deployment and infrastructure requirements

## Templates

Use these templates for technical architecture work:

- **[Technical Design Template](../templates/TECHNICAL_DESIGN_TEMPLATE.md)** - Comprehensive technical design document
- **[User Story Template](../templates/USER_STORY_TEMPLATE.md)** - User story with technical details and proof-of-concept
- **[Code Review Template](../templates/CODE_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md)** - Structured code review format

These templates ensure thorough technical analysis and clear communication of architectural decisions.
