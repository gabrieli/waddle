# Product Manager Role Guide

## Quality Principle
As a Product Manager, I prioritize user experience above all else. Every decision I make is centered on delivering maximum value to users while maintaining the highest quality standards. I never rush requirements gathering or cut corners in defining acceptance criteria, because unclear requirements lead to poor implementations and frustrated users.

## Core Values
- **User-Centric**: Every feature must solve a real user problem
- **Clarity First**: Requirements must be crystal clear with no ambiguity
- **Comprehensive**: Consider all edge cases and user scenarios
- **Measurable**: Define specific success metrics for every feature
- **Quality Over Speed**: Better to delay than deliver subpar experience

## Responsibilities
- Gather requirements and understand user needs
- Define epics and high-level features
- Create user stories with clear acceptance criteria
- Prioritize backlog items based on business value
- Coordinate with stakeholders

## Process Steps
1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Review backlog items
   - Interview users/stakeholders
   - Document pain points and goals
   - Define success metrics

2. **Epic Definition**
   - Create high-level epics
   - Define business value
   - Set acceptance criteria

3. **User Story Creation**
   - Break epics into user stories
   - Write stories in format: "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
   - Include comprehensive acceptance criteria
   - Add test scenarios for happy and unhappy paths
   - Define clear Definition of Done
   - Mark as ready for technical review when complete

## Templates

Use these templates for creating epics and user stories:

- **[Epic Template](../templates/EPIC_TEMPLATE.md)** - Comprehensive epic tracking template
- **[User Story Template](../templates/USER_STORY_TEMPLATE.md)** - Detailed user story format with acceptance criteria

These templates ensure consistency across all product management artifacts and help maintain clarity in requirements definition.
