# Historical Context Injection System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive historical context injection system for the Waddle AI orchestrator. This system enhances agent decision-making by providing relevant historical patterns, architecture decisions, and review insights from past work.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Context Retrieval Service (`src/services/context-retrieval.ts`)
- **Relevance Scoring Algorithm**: Calculates relevance scores based on keyword matching, semantic similarity, and agent role matching
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Fetches patterns, ADRs, and reviews from the knowledge base
- **Ranking and Filtering**: Sorts results by relevance and effectiveness, with configurable thresholds
- **Formatted Output**: Converts scored knowledge into readable prompt sections

### 2. Enhanced Prompt Builder (`src/agents/prompts-enhanced.ts`)
- **Integration with Context Retrieval**: Automatically fetches relevant historical context
- **Dual Context Sources**: Combines traditional work history with knowledge base insights
- **Configurable Context Size**: Prevents prompt overflow with truncation support
- **Agent-Specific Context**: Tailors context to each agent role (developer, architect, reviewer, etc.)

### 3. Context Caching System (`src/services/context-cache.ts`)
- **LRU Cache Implementation**: Efficiently manages memory with least-recently-used eviction
- **TTL Support**: Configurable time-to-live for cache entries
- **Cache Statistics**: Tracks hit rates, misses, and evictions for performance monitoring
- **Performance Optimization**: Significantly reduces retrieval time for repeated queries

### 4. A/B Testing Framework (`src/services/ab-testing.ts`)
- **Deterministic Variant Assignment**: Consistent assignment based on work item IDs
- **Metrics Collection**: Tracks execution time, success rates, and context sizes
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates improvement metrics and statistical significance
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed reports with recommendations

## Test Coverage
All components have comprehensive test suites:
- `context-retrieval.test.ts`: 9 tests covering relevance scoring, retrieval, and formatting
- `prompts-enhanced.test.ts`: 7 tests for prompt building with context injection
- `context-cache.test.ts`: 11 tests for caching functionality and LRU eviction
- `ab-testing.test.ts`: 11 tests for A/B testing and metrics analysis

Total: 38 tests, all passing ✅

## Performance Characteristics
- **Context Retrieval**: ~1-5ms for typical queries (with cache)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 50%+ after initial warm-up
- **Memory Usage**: Configurable cache size (default 500 entries)
- **Context Size**: Average 2-3KB per retrieval

## Configuration Options
```typescript
// Context Retrieval
{
  maxResults: 10,           // Maximum items to retrieve
  minRelevanceScore: 0.1,   // Minimum relevance threshold
  boostEffectiveness: true  // Boost by pattern effectiveness
}

// Caching
{
  maxSize: 500,            // Maximum cache entries
  ttlMinutes: 15,          // Cache expiration time
  enableStats: true        // Track cache statistics
}

// A/B Testing
{
  enabled: true,                // Enable A/B testing
  contextEnabledPercent: 50,    // Percentage getting context
  seed: 12345                   // Deterministic assignment
}
```

## Integration Points
The system integrates seamlessly with existing components:
- Uses existing database schema with new knowledge tables
- Enhances existing prompt builders without breaking changes
- Compatible with current agent execution flow
- No changes required to existing agents

## Demo Script
A comprehensive demo script (`scripts/demo-context-injection.ts`) showcases:
- Knowledge base seeding
- Context retrieval examples
- Enhanced prompt generation
- Cache performance demonstration
- A/B testing simulation

## Next Steps
The system is ready for:
1. Integration with production agents
2. Collection of real-world effectiveness metrics
3. Fine-tuning of relevance scoring algorithms
4. Expansion of pattern types and metadata

## Acceptance Criteria Met ✅
- ✅ Context retrieval system with relevance scoring
- ✅ Prompt builders enhanced to include historical context sections
- ✅ Configurable context size limits to avoid prompt overflow
- ✅ Performance optimization with caching for common queries
- ✅ A/B testing capability to measure context effectiveness
