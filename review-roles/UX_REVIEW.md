- [ ] Focus indicators are visible

### 2. User Experience

## Output Format
```json
{
  "status": "pass|warning|fail|not_applicable",
  "applicability": "high|medium|low|none",
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
      "file": "components/Button.jsx",
      "line": 25,

## Applicability Guidelines
- **None**: Backend-only, API changes, build scripts, non-UI code
- **Low**: Minor UI text changes, internal component refactoring
- **Medium**: New UI components, style changes, form modifications
- **High**: New pages, major UI features, accessibility implementations

## Severity Guidelines
- **Critical**: Accessibility barriers, completely unusable features
- **High**: WCAG violations, poor user experience, missing states
- **Medium**: Inconsistent patterns, minor accessibility issues
- **Low**: Enhancement suggestions, minor improvements

## Review Scope
Only review files in the current commit. Skip if changes are backend-only or don't affect user interface.
