# Waddle: Autonomous Development System Vision

## Executive Summary

Waddle is an autonomous development system that orchestrates AI agents to collaborate on software development tasks, mimicking a real development team. The system enables parallel, distributed work where multiple agents can process different work items simultaneously, creating a scalable and efficient development pipeline.

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Agent Autonomy
Each agent operates independently with a specific role and responsibility. Agents claim work, process it, and release it without central coordination beyond the initial assignment.

### 2. Distributed Processing
Multiple instances of each agent type can run concurrently, enabling true parallel processing of work items. The system uses work item locking to prevent conflicts.

### 3. Role-Based Specialization
Agents are specialized by role, each with distinct capabilities and decision-making authority within their domain.

### 4. Stateless Operation
Agents are stateless and derive all context from the database, enabling horizontal scaling and fault tolerance.

## System Architecture

### Work Item Hierarchy
```
Epic (High-level feature)
  └── Story (User-facing functionality)
        └── Task (Technical implementation unit)
```

### Work Item States
1. **backlog** - Waiting to be processed
2. **ready** - Dependencies met, ready for work
3. **in_progress** - Actively being worked on
4. **review** - Completed, awaiting review
5. **done** - Fully completed and approved

### Agent Roles

#### 1. Manager Agent
**Purpose**: Orchestrates work distribution and monitors progress

**Responsibilities**:
- Analyzes available work items
- Determines next appropriate action for each item
- Routes work to appropriate specialist agents
- Marks completed work as done
- Creates new work items when needed

**Decision Logic**:
- Epic in backlog → assign to architect
- Story in ready → assign to developer
- Work in review → assign to appropriate reviewer
- Reviewed and approved work → mark as done
- Blocked items → wait or escalate

**Parallel Operation**:
- Each manager instance claims a single work item
- Multiple managers can run concurrently
- Prevents double-processing through database locks

#### 2. Architect Agent
**Purpose**: Technical design and work breakdown

**Responsibilities**:
- Analyzes epics to understand requirements
- Creates technical approach and architecture
- Breaks epics into implementable user stories
- Identifies risks and dependencies
- Documents technical decisions

**Output**:
- 3-5 user stories per epic
- Technical approach documentation
- Risk assessment
- Dependency mapping

**Quality Standards**:
- Stories follow "As a... I want... So that..." format
- Clear acceptance criteria for each story
- Realistic effort estimates (small/medium/large)
- Considers existing codebase patterns

#### 3. Developer Agent
**Purpose**: Implementation of user stories

**Responsibilities**:
- Implements stories according to specifications
- Follows established coding patterns
- Writes tests (TDD approach preferred)
- Updates documentation
- Reports implementation status

**Implementation Process**:
1. Understand story requirements and context
2. Review technical approach from architect
3. Implement with test-first methodology
4. Ensure code quality and standards
5. Move to review when complete

**Output**:
- Working code implementation
- Test coverage
- Updated documentation
- Implementation notes
- List of changed files

#### 4. Code Quality Reviewer Agent
**Purpose**: Ensures code quality and standards

**Review Criteria**:
- Meets all acceptance criteria
- Code quality and maintainability
- Adequate test coverage
- Follows project conventions
- Security considerations
- Performance implications

**Actions**:
- Approve and move to done
- Request changes with specific feedback
- Escalate critical issues

### Future Agent Roles (Planned)

#### 5. Security Reviewer Agent
- Reviews code for security vulnerabilities
- Checks for exposed secrets or credentials
- Validates input sanitization
- Ensures secure coding practices

#### 6. Performance Reviewer Agent
- Analyzes performance implications
- Identifies potential bottlenecks
- Suggests optimizations
- Validates scalability

#### 7. Documentation Agent
- Ensures documentation completeness
- Updates API documentation
- Maintains architectural diagrams
- Creates user guides

#### 8. QA Tester Agent
- Creates test scenarios
- Performs integration testing
- Validates user experience
- Reports bugs with reproduction steps

#### 9. DevOps Agent
- Reviews deployment configurations
- Validates CI/CD pipelines
- Ensures monitoring and logging
- Checks infrastructure requirements

## Orchestration Mechanics

### Work Distribution
1. **Polling Cycle**: System polls for available work every 30 seconds
2. **Work Claiming**: Agents claim work items to prevent conflicts
3. **Lock Management**: 30-minute timeout on stale locks
4. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents of same type can run concurrently

### Communication Pattern
Agents communicate through:
1. **Database State**: Work item status and properties
2. **Work History**: Audit trail of all actions and decisions
3. **Agent Output**: Structured JSON responses stored in history

### Error Handling
1. **Graceful Failures**: Agents release locks on error
2. **Retry Logic**: Stale locks are automatically released
3. **Error Logging**: All errors recorded in work history
4. **Fallback Behavior**: Manager can perform basic actions if specialized agents fail

## Configuration and Scaling

### Parallel Processing Configuration
```json
{
  "parallelMode": true,
  "maxConcurrentManagers": 3,
  "maxConcurrentArchitects": 2,
  "maxConcurrentDevelopers": 5,
  "maxConcurrentReviewers": 3
}
```

### Model Selection
Different agents can use different Claude models based on task complexity:
- Manager: Smaller, faster model for routing decisions
- Architect: Larger model for complex design work
- Developer: Large model for implementation
- Reviewers: Varied based on review complexity

## Integration Points

### 1. Claude CLI Integration
- Agents execute as headless Claude instances
- Prompts are carefully crafted for each role
- Responses are parsed as structured JSON

### 2. Git Integration
- Developers create branches for stories
- Commit with meaningful messages
- Create pull requests when ready
- Link PRs to work items

### 3. GitHub Integration
- Sync work items with GitHub issues
- Update issue status automatically
- Create PRs through GitHub API
- Monitor PR reviews and CI status

### 4. External Tools (Future)
- IDE integration for code analysis
- Static analysis tools
- Security scanning tools
- Performance profiling tools

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality Standards
1. **Consistency**: Follow existing patterns
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage

### Review Process
1. **Multi-Stage Review**: Different aspects reviewed by specialized agents
2. **Iterative Improvement**: Work sent back if changes needed
3. **Quality Gates**: Must pass all reviews before completion
4. **Continuous Learning**: Agents learn from review feedback

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics
1. **Throughput**: Work items completed per hour
2. **Cycle Time**: Average time from backlog to done
3. **Quality**: Percentage of work passing review first time
4. **Utilization**: Agent busy time vs idle time
