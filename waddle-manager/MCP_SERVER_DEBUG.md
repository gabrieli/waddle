# MCP Server Debug Summary

## Server Status
The MCP server is **working correctly** and accepting connections on port 5173.

## Available Endpoints

### HTTP Endpoints
- **Health Check**: `GET http://localhost:5173/health`
- **List Tools**: `GET http://localhost:5173/tools`
- **JSON-RPC**: `POST http://localhost:5173/rpc`

### WebSocket Endpoint
- **WebSocket**: `ws://localhost:5173`

## Available MCP Tools
1. `startDevelopment` - Start development mode to begin processing tasks
2. `stopDevelopment` - Stop development mode to pause task processing
3. `getDevelopmentStatus` - Get current development mode status
4. `createFeature` - Create a new feature for autonomous development
5. `getProgress` - Get progress of features and tasks
6. `queryFeatures` - Query features with filters
7. `pauseWork` - Pause work on features
8. `resumeWork` - Resume work on features
9. `setFeaturePriority` - Update the priority of a feature
10. `reportTaskCompletion` - Report completion of an assigned task (called by Claude instances)
11. `reportTaskProgress` - Report progress on current task (called by Claude instances)

## Connection Test
The `test-mcp-connection.js` script has been updated to properly test all endpoints. Run it with:
```bash
node test-mcp-connection.js
```

## Key Findings
1. The server is running and listening on port 5173
2. CORS is properly configured (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`)
3. Both HTTP and WebSocket connections are working
4. JSON-RPC protocol is functioning correctly
5. The initial test script failed due to incorrect import syntax for node-fetch v3

## Common Connection Issues
If you're experiencing connection refused errors from other clients:
1. Ensure the client is connecting to `http://localhost:5173` (not https)
2. Check if any firewall is blocking port 5173
3. Verify the client supports the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol
4. For WebSocket connections, use socket.io-client library
